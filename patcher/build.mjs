/**
 * Adapted from the patcher of naudh1r's Venus University Photo Feature mod (AGPL-3.0-only),
 * https://github.com/naudh1r/venus-university.
 *
 * Builds the mod's download from two `out` folders of the game's code: the official one, taken
 * out of the shipped `app.asar`, and this mod's `electron-vite build`. Only the code files that
 * differ go into it; every art and font file is identical between the two, so the official
 * game's own copies are kept and none are shipped. Fails if the mod's build points at any file
 * the official game does not have.
 *
 *   node build.mjs --base <official out dir> --mod <mod out dir>
 *                  --game-version 0.3.0 --mod-version 0.1.0
 *
 * With `--over photo-feature --over-version 1.1.3 --over-base <dir> --over-mod <dir>` the same
 * download also goes on top of that other mod: the patch tells which game it is given and does
 * the right thing. `--over-base` is the `out` of a game with that mod installed by its own
 * setup, and `--over-mod` a build of both mods' source merged: the code of two mods cannot be
 * layered file by file, since both change the same few bundles. For that case the download
 * carries no code file, only a delta for each: what turns the other mod's installed file into
 * the merged one. None of the other mod's code is in it.
 *
 * The download is one exe, the setup wizard (`Setup.cs`), with the patch zipped inside it,
 * compiled with Windows' own C# compiler: here when this runs on Windows, or by the
 * `build-setup.cmd` it leaves in `dist/` when it runs anywhere else.
