/**
 * That every core file the photo feature hooks into still calls into it.
 *
 * This is a port. Everything the feature *is* lives in files of its own, but a handful of the
 * build's own files have to call into them, and those files belong to somebody else — they are
 * replaced wholesale when a new release is synced. A hook that does not survive that sync mostly
 * fails silently: the game builds, launches and plays, and only the photographs quietly stop.
 * Half of them cannot even fail loudly in principle, a stylesheet's scheme allowlist and a
 * prompt's brief having no compiler to answer to.
 *
 * So this reads the files as text and asserts the call is still written in them. It is a crude
 * test and it knows it: it proves the line exists, not that it runs, and a rename will fail it
 * for a hook that is perfectly fine. Both are the right way round for what it is guarding —
 * after a sync the question is "did anything fall out", and a false alarm costs a glance while a
 * missed one costs a playthrough.
 *
 * What it cannot see, `photoFlow.test.ts` covers: a hook that survived in the text but no longer
 * runs where it has to.
