# Installer

Builds the Venus Extracurriculars installer: a no-exe zip and a small setup wizard that put a
build of this repository into an **official** Venus University folder, and take it out again.
Players need only the official game from itch.io; nothing else is installed.

Adapted from the setup of naudh1r's Photo Feature mod
(https://github.com/naudh1r/venus-university, AGPL-3.0-only), with thanks.

## How it works

- `patch.mjs` does the work. It runs on the game's own exe: Venus University is an Electron app,
  and with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` its exe is a plain Node.js, so no Node.js ships with it.
- The game's code is `resources/app.asar`. Install backs it up, swaps in the build's code and
  adds the files its mods bring, and writes `resources/venus-extracurriculars.json`. Uninstall
  puts the backup back.
- Before changing anything, install checks the game is the official version the build was made
  for: the version in `resources/build-manifest.json`, and the hash of every file it replaces or
  removes. A game that still has Continuing Semesters or Photo Feature installed on its own is
  told to uninstall it first; both are in the build.
- If the game's code changes underneath (an official update), the install is already gone: its
  backup is deleted rather than restored over the new code.
- `Setup.cs` is the wizard, plain C# for the .NET Framework that comes with Windows. It carries
  `patch.mjs` and its payload zipped inside, checked against a SHA-256 before it runs.
  `Setup.exe install|uninstall "<game folder>"` works without the window.

## What goes in the download

The build compares two `out` folders, the official release's and this build's:

- every code file (`.js`, `.css`, `.html`) that differs or is new goes in;
- every file that only this build has goes in: a mod's own assets, such as City Life's
  backgrounds (each mod documents where its assets come from in `docs/mods/`);
- a file of the official game's that differs or is gone and is **not** code stops the build.
  None of Venus Dev's art, music or characters can end up in the download.

## The no-exe download

`Venus-Extracurriculars-<version>-no-exe.zip` is the same `patch.mjs` and payload with two small
launchers, `Install.cmd` and `Uninstall.cmd`, in place of the wizard. This is the download to
offer: antivirus tools flag an unsigned exe that unpacks a zip and rewrites another program's
files, which is exactly what the wizard does. Everything in the zip can be read before it runs.

## Building a release

Only for a game version Venus Dev has released himself, on itch.io.

1. **The official `out`**, taken out of the shipped game:
   `npx @electron/asar extract "<game>/resources/app.asar" official`, then use `official/out`.
   Its files are the hashes a player's game is checked against, so they must come from the
   release itself.
2. **This build's `out`**: `npx electron-vite build` on `main`, at the commit being released.
3. In this folder:

   ```
   npm install
   node build.mjs --base <official out> --build <build out> --game-version 0.4.0
   ```

   The build's name and version come from `BUILD` in `src/shared/mods.ts`
   (`--build-version` overrides the version).

The wizard is compiled on Windows with the C# compiler that comes with Windows. Built anywhere
else, `dist/` gets `build-setup.cmd`: copy `dist/` to a Windows PC and double-click it. The exe
is not signed, so SmartScreen warns about an unknown publisher the first time.

Then install, play and uninstall on a clean copy of the official game before publishing.
