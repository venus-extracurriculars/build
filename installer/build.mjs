/**
 * Builds the Venus Extracurriculars installer: a no-exe zip and a setup wizard that put a build
 * of this repository into an official Venus University folder, and take it out again.
 *
 * It compares two `out` folders of the game's code, the official release's and this build's,
 * and the download carries only what differs: every code file, and the files a mod adds (City
 * Life's backgrounds, say). A file of Venus Dev's that differs and is not code stops the build,
 * so none of his art, music or characters can end up in the download.
 *
 *   node build.mjs --base <official out> --build <this build's out> --game-version 0.4.0
 *                  --manifest <official resources/build-manifest.json>
 *                  [--build-version 0.1.0] [--out <folder>] [--assets <folder>]
 *
 * The game also keeps files outside its code, in `resources/assets`: the cast, the music, the
 * image workflows. The release's `build-manifest.json` lists every one with its hash, so the files
 * a mod adds there (Photo Feature's photo workflow, say) are found the same way, and one of Venus
 * Dev's own that differs stops the build.
 *
 * `--build-version` defaults to `BUILD.version` in `src/shared/mods.ts`.
