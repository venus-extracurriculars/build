# The Venus Whisper

An optional campus gossip newsletter, accessed from **Bunnyboard → Whisper**.
It gives the former Journals concept one shared column and discussion, separate from
character profiles, Bunnyboard Updates, and Meanwhile's spectator conversations.

## Playing

- Enable **The Venus Whisper** in Mods. It works with every other optional mod off.
- One issue arrives automatically each **in-game Wednesday**, while the game is running,
  even with Bunnyboard closed. It uses the past week's public material as of Wednesday
  morning. An unread dot on the Whisper tab stays until you read all unread issues.
  Reading saved issues makes no AI call. Delivery waits for a safe save checkpoint.
- Enabling the mod or loading a save later in the week catches up only the latest Wednesday;
  it does not generate an entire missed backlog. No issue arrives before the first Wednesday.
- The byline is anonymous. NPC comments use their regular names, handles and profile pictures.
- Player comments use the player's Bunnyboard profile name and a name-derived handle (for
  example, Sam Rowe becomes `@sam_rowe`). The base game has no separately editable player
  handle. Older player comments saved as `@reader` display and reach reply prompts with the
  name-derived handle; their saved IDs and reply links remain unchanged.
- Comment on the article or select **Reply** on a particular comment. Type `@handle` or use
  **Mention** to tag a known character. NPCs can answer; sometimes other students chime in.
- Direct replies retain their parent comment; comments on the main article are explicitly
  identified as article comments in the reply request. Tags and unambiguous greetings such
  as "Hi, Lili" prioritize that known person. Other commenters are told they are bystanders,
  not the recipient of a greeting meant for somebody else. First names shared by multiple
  known people require a full name or @handle to select one reliably.
- Replies appear with short pauses and typing indicators. They are already saved when their
  reveal starts, so closing the viewer does not lose completed replies.
- If a reply request fails, the player's comment stays saved. **Get replies** retries the
  unanswered comment. A successful batch is not generated twice.
- Weekly discussions stay open until the following Wednesday (or the semester ends).
  Older issues remain readable archives. Existing daily editions keep their old two-day window.
- **Delete issue**, followed by **Confirm delete issue**, deletes that issue and discussion
  from the active save. It will not be generated again that week. Earlier game saves retain
  their own copies, following the normal save/rewind rules.

Automatic delivery of an issue and its initial comments uses up to two calls to the configured writer.
A player comment uses at most one reply call. There are no image-generation calls or new
remote services. A quiet week produces a short editorial rather than invented named events.
Provider failures retry at most once per new in-game clock slot; **Retry delivery** retries
explicitly. A published issue survives a failed initial-comment request; **Get replies**
can finish its discussion without regenerating the article.

## The secret columnist

The first settled slot with the mod enabled chooses one enrolled character, retained in the
normal boundary save. This lets her start collecting sightings before the first Wednesday.
If publication happens first (for example, enabling the mod midweek), it saves that choice
**before** the paid writing request. A failed request never rerolls her. New, unrelated games
choose their own author. Loading an earlier save restores the identity and publications in that save.

The author occasionally joins the comments under her ordinary account (a 25% inclusion roll
per batch, or when explicitly addressed). She receives the same comment-generation task as
every other participant. The comment request is never told which person is the author.
It contains the public article, a short thread window, and ordinary character profiles only.
It prohibits identity guesses, insider hints, knowing winks, and conspicuous denials; a
validator rejects several obvious self-identification patterns. Model compliance with tone
and discretion still needs playtesting: a pattern guard cannot understand every implication.

The article request receives a bounded temperament and one rotating preference from up to
three saved character likes, with names/handles redacted. It does not receive an author ID,
handle, biography, save memories, private conversations, or full timetable. It asks for **one
small incidental clue per issue**: a preference-based metaphor, a personality tell, or a broad
classmate/worker/bystander perspective supported by a recorded sighting. This gives attentive
readers something to connect across issues without printing a signature or announcing the
answer. A preference is writing flavor, not proof that an incident happened. Comments still
receive ordinary public profiles and are never told the secret role or the private clue data.

Continuing Semesters carries the **same author**, profile snapshot, issues, comments, reply
links and deletion markers. The identity stays even if she graduates, is omitted from the
next roster, or her character file is later unavailable. A previously known columnist can
continue to comment through her saved public profile. Other known readers' public profiles
are kept too, so alumni participation does not single her out. Graduation does not put her back on
the map or change enrollment. Missing portraits fall back to an initial.

Anonymity is a story rule, not encryption: this is a local game, and a player inspecting the
save or code can discover the stored identity. No reveal mechanic is implemented.

## Evidence and roleplay

The editor selects one supported lead from known characters' public posts and **recorded
firsthand sightings**, then sends at most six relevant snippets. At each settled slot, the
collector checks newly settled native NPC encounters against the author's actual class,
work shift, or whereabouts. It reuses the native timetable's holiday, absence, mood, and
current-overlay rules. A rolled run-in that moves her away from her usual haunt wins over
that haunt. Being in the same dorm does not prove she heard a conversation: dorm run-ins
qualify only when the encounter actually includes her. Characters involved in the player's
scene are excluded; no private scene is mined for gossip. This mod never rolls extra meetings
or changes anyone's schedule.

Sightings keep their original semester, day, time, public venue and broad outcome. The native
encounter only establishes getting along or a tense interaction, not exact dialogue, motives,
or a romance. A later timetable change cannot retroactively manufacture an eyewitness. A
Wednesday-morning issue excludes the completed Wednesday day-slot, including delayed delivery.
Public posts need no physical proximity but are labeled as posts; the writer must attribute
them instead of pretending the columnist was there. Alumni can still read public posts but
do not gain physical campus sightings while absent from the enrolled roster.

Existing saves keep their author and published issues. There is **no retrospective invention
of sightings** for old encounters lacking a slot-specific record. The next issues may rely on
public posts or a quiet editorial while new observations accumulate. The prompt asks
for a scandalous, mischievous column about one specific person and incident, with at most
one other central figure. It discourages ensemble roundups and gives the previous issue's
subjects a small selection penalty to encourage variety. Held/pending photo posts, future posts, private
room visits, private DMs, scene transcripts, character notes, relationship memories, SQLite
recall, and Meanwhile's generated dialogue are excluded before the writing request.

The column may interpret those observations, but its speculation is not a new canonical
event. Commenters know only the public thread and their supplied personality, not private
events behind it. Player comments are public statements by the reader, not commands to
change the world's facts.

Scenes and both normal/regenerated DMs can receive at most two relevant issues whose
discussion windows are still open, with selected recent comments. The excerpt is capped at 6,500 characters,
plus a short attribution instruction. The secret identity is never included. The prompt
labels it unreliable public gossip, permits natural reactions when relevant, and grants no
firsthand knowledge or automatic relationship changes. Publication itself does not award
affection, spirit, stats, money or Story Memory facts. Normal scene bookkeeping still applies
to what the reader subsequently does in a scene.

## Bunnyboard navigation

Whisper and Meanwhile each have their own rail tab and shared outline icon in the page header.
Neither occupies the Game menu. The phone owns dismissal and theme; changing tabs unmounts
the page, cancels its unfinished comment requests and typing timers, and keeps already saved replies.
Scheduled delivery continues when the phone closes or changes tabs. The unread dot clears
only after opening an issue and successfully saving its read status.
Disabling the selected feature returns to Chats. The archive and article scroll separately;
the composer stays visible below the article. The rail contracts to the native five destinations
when both features are off. No SQLite integration is required.

## Save format and integration

`GameSave.exVenusWhisper` is an optional version-1 object with `author`, `people`, `issues` and
`dismissed`, plus optional `observations` and `author.interests`. Saves without the feature
normalize to an empty newsletter; older newsletter saves keep their existing data. It is declared through module
augmentation, and does not increase the required native save schema. The normalizer copies
only recognized fields, caps articles at 2,400 characters, comments at 600, discussions at
40 comments, public profiles at 128, and the archive/deletion list at 1,000 entries each. This covers the normal
four-year course with room for its weekly publications and older daily editions; exceeding the cap retains newer entries.

Observation storage is capped at 128 entries. Collection retains at most 21 days from the
current term so late-week Wednesday catch-up can still use the correct preceding week;
only that issue's seven-day window reaches the writer. Each observation is validated against
the saved author and a stable `witness:<term>:<day>:<time>:<pair>` key. Duplicate or malformed
entries are dropped. Only the public snippet and broad perspective reach generation; the
local author identifier stays out of that request. Three preference strings are capped at
120 characters each, and at most one is sent per issue. None of this requires SQLite.

New issues add optional `weekly: true` and `read: false` fields without changing the format
version. Legacy issues lacking those fields count as already read and retain their two-day
discussion window. An existing or deleted daily issue within the current Wednesday week
counts as that week's edition, preventing duplicates when upgrading.

Each issue's stable key is `whisper:<termIndex>:<dayIndex>`. Original zero-based semester and
day stamps stay on it across a break. They are displayed as human-readable semester/day
numbers. They do not need the date rebasing used by native memories. Comment IDs and reply
links are scoped to an issue; a normalizer drops duplicate IDs and invalid parent links.
Discussion and delivery gates compare both semester and day, so an old day-zero issue cannot
become today's issue in a new semester.

Turning the mod off retains the saved identity/archive and disables observation collection, its tab, generation and
extra prompt context. Semester carryover retains it even while off. Saves/backup exports
already carry optional save fields; no sidecar database or new installer is required.
This does not import legacy EX journal archives or any person's playthrough data.

The mod depends on neither Story Memory/SQLite, Breakthrough, City Life, Meanwhile, nor Photo
Feature. It respects held photo posts when that optional field exists. Story Memory remains
save-authoritative; the newsletter does not write rumors as confirmed SQLite facts.

The optional term-carry registry retains newsletter data with its original term/day stamps;
these deliberately are not shifted at a break. Old sightings never become evidence for a
new term. The settled-slot and scene/DM hooks keep this mod independent of other features.

## Validation and handoff

Automated checks cover repeated carryover when the author leaves the roster; save/load and
new-game isolation; malformed archive/thread data; private/future/held material exclusion;
ordinary author comments without privileged prompt fields; repeat publication/reply guards;
closing, loading, time changes and switching off while a response is outstanding; disk failure;
and switching off without erasing data. The native save-field inventory includes the new field.
Delivery can finish generating while a scene is busy, then waits to persist into the live
checkpoint without rolling back its date or money. Loading another save, leaving the game,
or disabling the mod cancels the job. Advancing the clock alone does not waste its response.

UI checks use synthetic saves and a stubbed writer, avoiding API charges or real private saves.
Exercise day and night at 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 1280×720 and 1440×1080, including all seven Bunnyboard rail tiles and each mod enabled alone. Check publication, article scrolling, tags, direct replies, pauses, the older-term
archive, and failure retry. Before release, playtest real-model editorial quality and subtlety
over several days; schema validation cannot certify believable prose or perfect discretion.
