/**
 * The places in the game a mod adds to, without editing the game's code there.
 *
 * The game asks here at each place: one line in its own file, the same whichever mods are
 * installed. A mod answers by registering, once, from its own files ({@link registerHooks}).
 * Mods are asked in the order `MODS` lists them, and **only while they are on**: a mod that is
 * off is not asked at all, so the game runs as it would without it.
 *
 * No imports at run time, so any file of the game can ask here without a circle of imports;
 * whether a mod is on is handed in by the mods store ({@link setHookRules}).
