/**
 * The picture on a post on her feed.
 *
 * What a post may show is flat, unlike a thread's. A post is public — there is no relationship
 * to read, no one reader it is for, and nothing she has been through with anybody changes what
 * her whole year gets to see. `allowedPostTier` says so: a swimsuit is ordinary on a feed, and
 * nothing past it is.
 *
 * The other rule here is that a post she took a picture for **waits for the picture**: it is
 * filed as the slot writes it, held (`postIsOut`), and comes out when the picture lands. A render
 * that fails, or that has not answered in {@link RENDER_PATIENCE_MS}, brings the post out anyway
 * with the frame saying so and a reroll on it — the words were written once, by the model, and
 * a machine that could not draw that minute is no reason to lose them. This is the one place the
 * feed and the thread part company — a bubble on a thread appears at once and fills in, because
 * her words have already landed and the reader is watching them land.
