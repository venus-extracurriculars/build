/**
 * What the photo feature adds to the save's shapes, added from outside them.
 *
 * Every field here could have been written into `types.ts` beside the interface it belongs to,
 * and in the build this was ported from it was. It is declared here instead because this
 * feature lives alongside a codebase it does not own: the upstream build is synced in whole
 * files, and a field added inside `types.ts` is a line that has to be found and re-inserted by
 * hand on every sync. An interface is open, so the same field can be declared from here and
 * mean exactly the same thing to the compiler — and a sync that overwrites `types.ts` carries
 * nothing away with it.
 *
 * Nothing imports this file for a value; it has none. It reaches the compiler because the
 * project includes `src`, and the augmentations below apply to the whole program from there.
