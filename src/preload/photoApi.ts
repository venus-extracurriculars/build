/**
 * The renderer's half of the photo channels.
 *
 * It hangs off `api.photo` rather than joining `api.comfy`, where the build this was ported from
 * kept it, for one reason: `comfy` in `api.d.ts` is an inline object literal, and an inline type
 * cannot be reached by declaration merging — every method would have to be written inside that
 * literal by hand, and re-written there after every sync. A top-level key is its own interface
 * member, so it can be declared from outside and `api.d.ts` never learns the feature exists.
 *
 * The declaration itself is in `shared/photoTypes.ts`, which is the one folder both the main and
 * renderer tsconfig projects include — this file is in neither's reach from the renderer side.
